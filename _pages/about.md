Xin chào, hello, 안녕하세요!

The world changes fast, so do I - from theory to domain-specific solutions, I adapt, learn, and deliver.

I'm Bui Tien Cuong (or Alex Bui), an AI expert with diverse experience in both academic researches and practical applications. I'm capable of managing and contributing to multiple projects at once, and my passion is turning innovative ideas into tangible results. I would love to build end-to-end large-scale AI systems from scratch.

I earned my master’s degree and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University (SNU), under the guidance of two distinguished professors Sang-Kyun Cha and Wen-Syan Li. During my six years at the Petabyte In-memory Database Lab, I delved into high-performance database architectures and collaborated on pioneering research under Professor Sang-Kyun Cha. This experience equipped me with profound insights into in-memory database and data science technologies. Further enriching my research experience, I collaborated with Professor Li at the Applied Machine Learning Lab, where I completed my Ph.D. thesis and published four papers at prestigious conferences, including the 23rd IEEE ICDM and PAKDD in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, our team developed innovative software solutions for practical challenges, such as an AI-based Music Annotation System, which you can explore here: [bit.ly/mosaicv2](https://bit.ly/mosaicv2). 

Before joining SNU, I got an engineering degree in Information Technology from SOICT, Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2017.
Between 2017 and 2019, I worked as a software engineer at an ERP software company, developing CRM solutions for a telesales company.

Driven by a strong curiosity and desire to address real-world problems, I am always looking to learn more and improve my skills. I am particularly interested in using my technical knowledge to tackle challendges in business problems. I also completed over ten Coursera courses and specializations to better understand business principles and management.

I can speak Vietnamese and English fluently. I also have a TOPIK 4 can use Korean at working-efficiency level.
